## About TopWatch

TopWatch is an efficiency tool to help you keep track of how much time you spend on any particular activities. It works best for keeping track of activities done on the computer since the application runs on the computer. For example, I use it to keep track of how much time I spend on various school assignments, video games, and independent projects.

## Usage

To run TopWatch, clone the repository onto your local machine and from the root directory of the repository and run the following command:

```
